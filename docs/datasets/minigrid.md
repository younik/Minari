# MiniGrid

Dataset generated from the [MiniGrid-FourRooms environment](https://minigrid.farama.org/environments/minigrid/FourRoomsEnv/). The objective of the agent is to reach a goal position in a gridworld.
We regenerate the dataset of [D4RL](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/D4RL/wiki/Tasks#minigrid-fourrooms) for full reproducibility, using a random policy and an expert policy that navigates straight to the goal.
