Kabuki is intended to be a Python library for conducting research in offline reinforcement learning, akin to an offline version of Gymnasium or an offline RL version of HugginFace's datasets library. The goal is to release a fully working beta in late November or early December.

We have a public discord server (which we also use to coordinate development work) that you can join here: https://discord.gg/jfERDCSw if you're interested in it.
